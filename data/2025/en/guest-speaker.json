    "title": "First-Order Theories for Secure Protocol Proofs: From Indistinguishability to Overwhelming Truth",
    "abstract": "Cryptographic protocols are critical components of secure communication over the internet. Numerous techniques have been devised to verify their security in the presence of active adversaries. Notably, automated verification tools like Tamarin, CryptoVerif, ProVerif, and F* were instrumental in the development of TLS 1.3. However, despite the maturity of these tools, challenges remain in analyzing specific classes of protocols, particularly those employing cryptographic primitives with algebraic properties.\n\nRecently the Computationally Complete Symbolic Attacker technique has gained popularity through the Squirrel Prover based on it. We review the basics of the two versions of its first-order theory, one focusing on indistinguishability the other on computability and trace properties. We discuss how the non-Tarskian semantics of the latter provides a first-order logic for \"overwhelming truth\".",

    "biography": "Dr. Gergei Bana received his M.S. degree in Physics from Eötvös University, Budapest, and both his M.A. in Statistics and Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, he serves as a Part-time Lecturer at Keio University. Prior to his current position, he served as an Assistant Professor at the University of Missouri. Dr. Bana has also held research positions at the University of Luxembourg, INRIA Paris, NTT Corporation, the Technical University of Lisbon, and University of California at Davis. His main interest is in the formal verification of security protocols. He focuses on the intersection of logic, cryptography, and formal verification, working on proof systems to verify provable cryptographic properties. He co-created the computationally complete symbolic attacker technique on which the verification tools Squirrel and CryptoVampire are based."
